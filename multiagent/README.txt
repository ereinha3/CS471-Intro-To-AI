I design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, I implement both minimax and expectimax search and design an evaluation function.
A project description can be found here: https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/24F/cs471/programming-projects/project2.html

Part 1: Implement a Reflex Agent
To see results of my implementation, run either of the following two commands.
python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent -l testClassic
python autograder.py -q q1

Part 2: Minimax
To see results of my implementation, run the following command.
python autograder.py -q q2

Part 3: Alpha-Beta Pruning
To see results of my implementation, run either of the following two commands.
python pacman.py -p AlphaBetaAgent -a depth=3 -l smallClassic
python autograder.py -q q3

Part 4: Expectimax
To see results of my implementation, run either of the following two commands.
python pacman.py -p ExpectimaxAgent -l minimaxClassic -a depth=3
python autograder.py -q q4

Part 5: Evaluation Function
To see results of my implementation, run the following command.
python autograder.py -q q5
